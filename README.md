# Fraud_detection_using_Machine_Learning
🚨 Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a fraud detection system using Machine Learning techniques. It analyzes transaction data to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. The goal is to help financial institutions, payment gateways, and businesses prevent losses caused by fraudulent activities.

📌 Features

✅ Data preprocessing & cleaning

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

✅ Machine Learning model training & evaluation

✅ Fraud vs. Legit transaction classification

✅ Streamlit app for interactive testing (optional)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries & Tools:

pandas, numpy → Data handling

matplotlib, seaborn → Visualization

scikit-learn → ML algorithms

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is a credit card transactions dataset (commonly from Kaggle
), which contains highly imbalanced data with only a small percentage of fraud cases.

⚠️ Note: The dataset is not included in this repo due to size restrictions. Please download it separately and place it inside the data/ folder.

🚀 Installation & Usage
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/workforyou786/Fraud_detection_using_Machine_Learning.git
cd fraud-detection-ml

2️⃣ Create a virtual environment & install dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Train the model
python src/train_model.py

4️⃣ Run predictions
python src/predict.py --input sample_transaction.json

5️⃣ (Optional) Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app/app.py
